# Atena - Educational AI Study Assistant

## Overview
Atena is an educational AI agent specialized in teaching Algorithms and Computational Thinking in Portuguese. It uses Google's Gemini-2.5-pro with URL context to process course PDFs.

## Configuration

### Required Setup

1. **Google API Key**: Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

2. **PDF Documents**: Place course PDFs in the `aulas/` folder:
   - `I_Teórico.docx.pdf` - Programming fundamentals
   - `II_Teórico.docx.pdf` - Control structures
   - `III_Teórico.docx.pdf` - Data structures
   - `IV_Teórico.docx.pdf` - Sorting algorithms

## How It Works

The agent uses Gemini's `url_context=True` feature to process PDFs. When you ask a question, Gemini:
1. Reads the PDF URLs from the instructions
2. Fetches and processes the PDF content
3. Uses the content to answer questions

## Important Notes

### URL Context Feature
- Gemini's `url_context=True` allows the model to fetch and read URLs
- For local files, use `file://` URLs (automatically generated by the agent)
- The PDFs are processed on-demand when questions are asked

### Missing Components
If URL context isn't working as expected, you might need:
1. **File URLs**: The agent converts local paths to `file://` URLs
2. **API Permissions**: Ensure your API key has access to Gemini-2.5-pro
3. **Alternative Approach**: If `url_context` doesn't work with local files, you might need to:
   - Host the PDFs on a web server
   - Or use Gemini's file upload API to process PDFs first
   - Or extract text from PDFs and include in the prompt

## Usage

```python
from ai.agents.atena.agent import get_atena_agent

# Create agent
agent = get_atena_agent()

# Ask questions in Portuguese
response = agent.run("O que são algoritmos?")
print(response.content)
```
